Flow control for applications should have a scaling model of tools and their implementations. For example, the idea that
we use a lot of HTTP post and get requests requires us to make methods for those things, given the need is simple but
abundant.

Abstracting these things out to to methods with simple IO is key. The only thing we care about when making a request is:

    - completing the request
    - adding custom headers
    - adding a custom body
    - using a different URL sometimes, so we can specify that
    - returning the body as a string so that we can parse through it manually

Additionally, the need for custom parsers given things like dealing with a specially delimited list, login, or formatted
information clusters may require compartmentalization, but at the moment, it seems unneeded.
